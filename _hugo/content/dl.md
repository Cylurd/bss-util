All releases for the latest version of bss-util are listed below as a zip file or a tar file, depending on platform. The SDK contains both the source code for bss-util, and precompiled versions of the library as both a DLL and a static lib file. On Windows, bss-util requires at least Visual Studio 2015, which can be [downloaded for free](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx). On any POSIX based system, a make file is included that will compile both the library and the test suite.
